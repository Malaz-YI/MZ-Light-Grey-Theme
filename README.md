# MZ Light Grey Theme

A hand crafted VSCode theme which tries to be easy on the eyes for people who struggle reading text on black/dark backgrounds, by implementing a UI based on a shade of gray that's not too bright, but not old-school looking either, which was inspired by Tolmak Gray Light theme. But finding the right token/syntax colors for such a background (and white backgrounds in general) is tricky, as many other light themes offer either very muted colors for a light theme, or too vibrant so many colors that go all over the place, and some just go with monochromic colors that weren't very exciting to look at. Thus, I tried my best to catch the sweet spot with as compact, yet at the same as diverse, color palette as possible and ended up with the default theme "Soft". The other optional theme "Sharp (Legacy)" was experimental and mainly an initial attempt to blend NetBeans Light theme and Atom One Light theme.


For some users' convenience, this theme packs an optional line highlighter for the default soft theme, one that is brighter than the background (theme titled: "Soft With Light Highlighter") and the other option comes with a dimmer line highlighter (theme titled: "Soft With Dark Highlighter").


I hope you enjoy this minimal theme and find a peace of mind - and eyes - with it!
