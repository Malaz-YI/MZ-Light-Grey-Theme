# MZ Light Grey Theme

A hand crafted combination of Tolmak Gray Light theme & Atom One Light Theme.

Atom's tokens colors are muted for a light theme, but Tolmak's was a bit too vibrant, thus I had to blend the two color palettes and find the middle sweet spot for the 6 most prominent highlight colors (Also I got the nice-looking main blue from NetBeans Light Theme and calibrated it a bit to fit the gray background).
