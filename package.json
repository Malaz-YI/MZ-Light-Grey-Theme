  "description": "A hand crafted combination of Tolmak's Gray Theme & Atom One Light Theme.  \nAtom's tokens colors are muted for a light theme, but Tolmak's was a bit too vibrant, thus I had to blend the two color palettes and find the middle sweet spot for the 6 most prominent highlight colors (Also I got the nice-looking main blue from NetBeans Light Theme and calibrated it a bit to fit the gray background)",
